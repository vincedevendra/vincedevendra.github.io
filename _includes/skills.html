        <p>
          I'm a web developer who loves making awesome tools and web applications,
        mostly using Ruby, Rails, and related tech.  I'm into well-tested code,
        practicing TDD/BDD and using RSpec, Capybara, and sometimes MiniTest to get the job done.  I'm
        competent with javascript and jQuery, but really thrive on back end
        work.
        </p>

        <p>

        I'm looking for work with a place to work and grow. I want that place
        to have a team where every member makes every other member better,        and I want it to care deeply about its mission and the quality of its
        product.
